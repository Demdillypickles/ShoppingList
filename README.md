A program to help keep track of item crafting and resources required in video games. 


## Purpose of Project
* As stated, this project will produce a program to assist in video games that feature
  complex crafting trees and material gathering.

* This project is intended to be a friendly place for beginners. Anyone is welcome, but 
  people looking to practice and learn GitHub, or programming in general should feel
  especially welcome.
  
* This project will continue to receive updates and new features for as long as there
  is an interest in adding them. When considering new features to add, anything that
  incorporates a new technology is encouraged, since this is primarily a learning project.
  (It will probably get bloated. A "feature manager" will included in later versions)
  
## Contributing
* There will always be a current development branch. This branch will be the current features
  that have the highest priority are developed. You can work on other things, but your code won't be
  pulled into the master/main branch until that feature is included in the development branch.
  (Please still continue to make your pull requests if you have finished code, just understand
  that it won't be pulled until it is relevent to the dev branch) 

* When new features are suggested, they will be placed on the project timeline. The timeline
  will detail the order in which features will be added. The purpose of the timeline is 
  to keep the group generally focused on the same thing, and to make sure that features
  don't outpace the main development effort.
  
* Please consult the timeline (TIMELINE.md) to see if a feature you want is already planned.
